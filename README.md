# Intel Product Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on Intel product reviews. The aim is to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering using TF-IDF
- Model Training using Naive Bayes Classifier
- Evaluation of Model Performance
- Visualization of Results

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bhumikavellore/intel-product-review-analysis.git
cd intel-product-review-analysis
```

## Usage
To use this project:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
2. Navigate to `Intel_Product_Review_Analysis.ipynb` and open it.
3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to see the data processing, model training, and evaluation process.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains Intel product reviews with corresponding sentiments. Make sure your dataset is formatted correctly as described in the notebook.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
3. **Model Training**: Training a Naive Bayes classifier on the vectorized text data.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Visualization**: Visualizing the results using various charts.

## Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 96%
- **Precision**: 95%
- **Recall**: 98%
- **F1-Score**: 97%
